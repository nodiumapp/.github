# Nodium
The Stadia revival project.

# ðŸ¤” How does it work?
Nodium works by having servers (nodes) run by users that run the games you want to play.

Every user can not only make their own servers, but also request games!
(DISCLAIMER! We currently accept primarily only public domain games. If you (the requester) have talked with a games publisher, and they have got a deal for us, the game may be accepted.)

## ðŸ–¥ How to request a server:
NOTE: You need to have the port: 13143, open on the server's internet network.

First, you need to have at least:
 - 4 GB of RAM
 - 256 GB of storage
 - A decent CPU that can play Minecraft ðŸ‘Œ
 - A GPU with the specs of an GTX 1660 (We can talk about lower specs)

When you have that covered, you can request your server [here](https://nodiuminfo.vercel.app/request).

If you get accepted, you will get a email with a ISO download, that you need to boot on your server.
In the first boot, it will ask you for your Nodium login. After that, it will ask you your server's region (Europe, North America..).

When that is done, it will download the game library.
After that, it will open a dashboard where you can configure settings.

If everything went correctly, there should be a green circle on the dashboard.
